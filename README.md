# PhoenixVue

This is learning Vue app. It uses Vue, Vue-Router, Vuex, Vue-Resource. It also connects with a backend phoenix app. 

The Vue app is in the `/client directory`

## The Phoenix App

It provides a few routes for the sake of login. We use `Guardian` to provide `JWT`. A user resource has required credentials for the sake of login

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/deployment).

## The Vue App

The documentation can be found inside the `/client` directory
